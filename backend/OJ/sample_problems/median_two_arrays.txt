Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

CONSTRAINTS:
- nums1.length == m
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m <= 1000
- 0 <= n <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

HINT:
If you understand the concept of partition in Quick Sort, this problem will be much easier.
The key insight is to partition two arrays into two halves such that all elements in the left half are less than or equal to all elements in the right half.
