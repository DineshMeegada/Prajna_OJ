Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a string s.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input:
abcabcbb
Output:
3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

EXAMPLE 2:
Input:
bbbbb
Output:
1

EXAMPLE 3:
Input:
pwwkew
Output:
3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

CONSTRAINTS:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

APPROACH:
Use the sliding window technique with a hash map to track character positions.
