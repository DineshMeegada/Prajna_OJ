Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return a boolean value indicating whether there exist two distinct elements in the array whose sum is equal to target.

You may assume that each number in the array may be used at most once in the sum.

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array nums.
The next n lines each contain an integer element of nums.
The last line contains an integer target.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print "true" if such a pair exists, otherwise print "false".

EXAMPLE 1:
Input:
4
2
7
11
15
9
Output:
true
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9.

EXAMPLE 2:
Input:
3
3
2
4
6
Output:
true
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6.

EXAMPLE 3:
Input:
2
3
3
6
Output:
true
Explanation: The sum of 3 and 3 is 6.

CONSTRAINTS:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.
